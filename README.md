Use R to analyse survey data relating to drug decriminalisation. This is an open dataset retrieved from the [UK Data Service](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/857543/).

## Survey Summary
People from the UK responded to a 19 question survey about their attitudes towards drug policy. The aim of the survey was to assess whether public opinion matched the UK government's 
seeming reluctance to introduce a more liberal drug policy. Furthermore, demographic information was collected to see if opinions differed between groups.
